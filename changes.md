# Mediocre Strategists Balance Mod: To-Do

## China

### Lore

The design idea behind everything in China is viewing a continent ~10 years after the Ming dynasty imploded. Minorities have broken free and multiple dynasties and regional powers struggle for supremacy.

Cornerstones:

- Dynasties don't form other Dynasties
- 

### Formable Paths

The following big Formables are planned:

Dynasties:

- Ming (for Ming Remnant states)
- Shu (for Qiang)
- Jin (For Northern Non-Dynastic Tags)
- "Dynasty of our own"
- Wu (Upgrade-Formable)

Super-Tags:

- National China (For Chinese non-dynasties)

Regional:

- Dali (for Bai-Nation and Muege)
- (Heavenly Kingdom (Event Based in Kaiming region))

Tags without Formables:

- Shun (already Great and a dynasty)
- Miao (irrelevant)
- Zhang & Hlai
- Taiwan

### Southern China

Southern China was the Focus of the 3.1 patch. It's the most refined part of China, but nowhere near complete.

To-Dos:

- New Flag for Dali
- Replace Dali with a Bai state at game start -> Dali formable
- Kaiming rework
- Add historical alliance between Lan Xang and Zhuang
- National Chinese Ideas (Formable for Canton)
- Add dynastic Path for Canton (Zhang Dynasty)
- Shu Formable for Qiang -> Path to Shu

### Western China

Planned for 3.2 patch.

To-Dos:

- Wu Rework (plus Wu Wei)
- Southern Ming Rework plus Ming-Remnant Mission tree and disaster -> Path to Ming
- Huai Rework -> Path to National China
- Trade League Rework -> Path to National China

### Northern China

Planned for 3.3 patch

To-Dos:

- Merge Yuyang into Northern Ming and apply Southern Ming features
- Shun rework
